                <h2 style="margin-left: 5%;">Alan Turing, James H.Wilkinson and Harry Huskey, they are all part of the National Physical Laboratory and they are created Pilot ACE, the prototype of the first computer of United-Kingdoms. Pilot ACE takes up Alan Turing's ACE calculator project. It was seven versions of Pilot ACE.</h2>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 5%;">This first execution was the 10 may 1950.</h2>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 5%;">The prototype was built to calculate multiplications or Euclidean divisions, and these operations were programmed and executed from an algorithm coded on punched cards, which allowed to change the calculation algorithms to be able to calculate multiplications or Euclidean divisions with scientific notations without touching the mechanism of the machine.</h2>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 5%;">Pilot ACE has a range of applications, including working out the stresses on an aeroplane’s fuselage, crystallography and computing bomb trajectories.</h2>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 5%;">Pilot ACE was estimated to have cost £50,000 to design and build, but by 1954 it had earned over £240,000 from advanced scientific and engineering.</h2>
                <h2 style="margin-left: 5%;">There was a marketed version of the ACE pilot, the DEUCE by English Electric & Co.</h2>

                <h2 style="margin-left: 5%;">Pilot ACE was in use until May 1955, when it was donated by the National Physical Laboratory to the Science Museum in London for display in the collection (Information Age Gallery: Web).</h2>
